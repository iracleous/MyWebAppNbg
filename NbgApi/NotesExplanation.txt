AddTransient
When you use AddTransient, a new instance of the service is created every time 
it's requested, and it's disposed of when the request is finished.
This is suitable for services that are stateless and don't maintain any state between requests.

AddScoped
When you use AddScoped, a single instance of the service is created for each scope. 
In a web application, a scope typically corresponds to an HTTP request.
The service instance is reused throughout the scope's lifetime and 
then disposed of when the scope ends.
This is useful for services that maintain some state during a single HTTP request.

AddSingleton
When you use AddSingleton, a single instance of the service is created for the lifetime 
of the application.
This means the service is shared among all requests and clients throughout the lifetime 
of the application.
It's suitable for services that are stateless or designed to be shared globally.
